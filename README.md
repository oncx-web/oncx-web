## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m currently working on Office Of The Naval Comptroller :ONC
I create blog posts and open source packages mainly about python and django framework.  I have a passion for learning and sharing my knowledge with others in a way that's as public as possible.  You can see a full list of what I am up to on [onc-team-dev](https://sites.google.com/view/onc-team-dev/home)).  If you found value in something I have created, please feel free to send a [TIP](https://buymeacoffee.com/oncx.web), give me a shout out [@_waylonwalker](https://twitter.com/_waylonwalker), give some â™¥ on [DEV.to/waylonwalker](https://dev.to/waylonwalker), or sign up for my newsletter  at waylonwalker.com/newsletter  I would love to see you join.
